# Topic Modelling-Singular Value Decomposition
"Applied advanced Natural Language Processing techniques to perform topic modeling on a diverse dataset using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), grouping documents based on shared word patterns. Additionally, leveraged Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and TruncatedSVD to efficiently reduce dimensionality in the analysis of book titles, uncovering latent semantic structures within the data. Demonstrated proficiency in handling sparse matrices, a key advantage of SVD over PCA. This project sheds light on document clustering and latent semantic analysis, showcasing expertise in text data processing."
